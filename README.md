# Simple Hyprland
Welcome to the Simple Hyprland Guide! This repository is designed to help users set up a minimal Hyprland environment on Arch Linux. Although various scripts and configuration files are available elsewhere, they often result in bloated systems with many unused themes and configurations. This guide aims to provide a clear, concise, and minimal setup, allowing users to understand each step and customize their environment to their liking.

### Purpose
This guide is intended for:
* Newcomers transitioning to Hyprland who want to gain knowledge.
* Users who wish to set up a minimal system their way, knowing what's happening at each step.
* Individuals looking to save time by following a structured and efficient setup process.

### Prerequisites
This guide assumes an understanding of Linux systems, particularly [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/). The following prerequisites are essential for the seamless installation and setup of Hyprland on your system.

For detailed prerequisites, refer to the [Prerequisites section](docs/prerequisites.md) in the docs folder.

### Compatibility
While this guide is created with Arch Linux in mind, it can also be helpful for users of other distributions who are familiar with their package management and system tweaking.

### Future Work
* A script to automate the whole process to save time.
* Small scripts to perform various tasks.
* Setup for NVIDIA card users.
* Showcasing cool derived minimal setups.
