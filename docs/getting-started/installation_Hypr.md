# Hyprland & Critical Softwares
Now that our base system is set up with all the prerequisites, it's time to start transforming your setup with Hyprland. In this section, we'll walk you through installing Hyprland and essential software to ensure a smooth and efficient workflow.

### Hyprland Installation
1. Install the Hyprland Package: 
    ```
    pacman -S hyprland
    ```
    Pro Tip: If you're feeling adventurous, you can always grab the bleeding-edge version from the AUR for the latest features and fixes.

2. Start the Hyprland Session: 
    ```
    Hyprland
    ```
3. Once you are in, you will see a bar on top with a warning and commands to launch Kitty and exit Hyprland.

    To remove the warning:
    * Launch Kitty using the shortcut `(SUPER + Q)` 
    * Edit the configuration file located at `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf` and comment out or remove the line saying `autogenerated = 1`.

    Some default keybindings to keep handy:
    * `SUPER + C`: Kill the active window
    * `SUPER + M`: Quit hyprland (but why would you want to?)

* How to access the web(this tutorial), open kitty and launch Firefox with `firefox`

4. Add the necessary environment variables to your `hyprland.conf`.

### Critical Softwares

    The XDG Desktop Portal handles various desktop functionalities, such as file pickers and screensharing.

    ```
2. Install Polkit:
    Polkit is used for managing system-wide privileges.

    ```
    pacman -S polkit-kde-agent
    ```
    * To autostart Polkit, add the following line to your hyprland.conf:
    ```
    exec-once=/usr/lib/polkit-kde-authentication-agent-1
    ```
    * make sure you don't give space between `=` and `/`.

3. QT Wayland Applications Support
    Install the necessary libraries for QT applications to work properly under Wayland.
    ```
    pacman -S qt5-wayland qt6-wayland
    ```
4. Install a Notification Daemon:
    A notification daemon is essential for handling system notifications. If you're unsure which to use, dunst is a worthy choice.
