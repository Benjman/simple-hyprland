# Prerequisites
Before we dive into the nitty-gritty of setting up Hyprland, let's make sure you've got your ducks in a row. These prerequisites will ensure a smooth sail through the installation and configuration process, so you can bask in the glory of a customized tiling experience.

### System Requirements
1. **Minimal Arch Linux Installation:** Follow the [Arch Linux Installation Guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide) to set up your base system. We're starting from scratch, folks â€“ a clean slate to unleash your customization prowess.

### Toolbox Essentials
1. **AUR Helper:** You'll need an [AUR helper](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/AUR_helpers) to tap into the goodness of the Arch User Repository. While any AUR helper will do the trick, I'm partial to [yay](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/yay) for its efficiency and user-friendliness.

2. **Audio Setup:** Install and configure [Pipewire](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PipeWire) and [Wireplumber](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/WirePlumber) for audio management. This modern audio setup will replace traditional systems like PulseAudio, providing better performance and flexibility.

3. **Nerd Fonts:** Elevate your visual game with these Nerd Fonts:
    * Cascadia Code
    * JetBrains Mono
    * Fira Code
    * Iosevka
    * Noto
    * Nerd Font Symbols
    
    These fonts aren't just easy on the eyes; they also boost icon support across your system, adding a touch of nerdiness to your setup.

4. **Display Manager:** While any display manager will work, I highly recommend [SDDM](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/SDDM) due to its high compatibility with Hyprland. 

5. **Web Browser:** We'll be using [Firefox](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/firefox) as our trusty internet companion. It's not just for browsing cat memes; it'll also be your gateway to configurations, wikis, and, of course, this guide.

6. **Terminal Application:** Install [Kitty](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Kitty) as your terminal emulator. While any terminal will technically work, the official Hyprland default config needs Kitty. Don't worry, we can always tweak it later if you prefer a different terminal (there's a workaround for everything, right?).

7. **Text/Code Editor:** Use any text or code editor that floats your boat. I'll be using Visual Studio Code for its user-friendliness and feature-richness, but if you're a vim loyalist, feel free to stick with your beloved editor.

### Skillset Checklist
1. **Basic Linux Command Line Knowledge:** You'll be spending some quality time in the terminal, so make sure you're comfortable with the command line.

2. **Package Management:** Understanding how to install and manage packages using pacman and an AUR helper is a must.

3. **Basic Configuration Editing:** Ability to edit configuration files using a text editor, including understanding basic syntax and structure.

4. **Troubleshooting:** Some hiccups may occur along the way, so basic troubleshooting skills will come in handy.

### Additional Recommendations
1. **Backup Your Data:** Ensure you have backups of any important data before embarking on this journey.

2. **Update Your System:** Keep your system up to date before starting the installation to avoid any potential conflicts.

With these prerequisites in check, you're all set to follow the Simple Hyprland guide and bask in the glory of a fully customized tiling experience on your Arch Linux system. Let the tiling adventure begin!
